Scenario: PF_P_01 Provider logs in to view feedback from apprentices when the minimum number of reviews has not been reached
Given the provider has been rated by apprentices as follows
	| AcademicYear | Rating    |
	| Current      | Excellent |
	| Current      | VeryPoor  |
	| Current      | Excellent |
	| Current      | Good      |
When The provider logs in to the provider portal
And the provider opts to view their feedback
Then they see the following text: "You'll see apprentice reviews after at least 5 apprentices give feedback during an academic year."
